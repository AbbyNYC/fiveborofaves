Restaurants 
Parks
Museums 

Welcome to the Team Four site featuring our Five Borough Favorites for dining, parks, and museums.  Of course, there is so much to see and do in NYC...
we just wanted to build a site that features the best of the best, in our opinion.  Hope you enjoy these places as much as we do!


Manhattan
  Gramercy Tavern https://www.gramercytavern.com/
  This is one of Abby's favorite restaurants in Manhattan.  She likes to eat in the Tavern near the front as opposed to the back of the restaurant's
  main dining room.  Gramercy Tavern has the best burgers Abby has ever tried!
  
  Central Park https://www.centralpark.com/
  One of Abby's favorite things in Cenral Park is the Carousel.  
  
  Whitney Museum https://whitney.org/
  This museum is pay what you wish on Friday nights and there are 4 roofs - one on each of the top floors of the museum - with spectacular views of 
  Manhattan and the New Jersey skyline.

Brooklyn 
  Peter Luger's https://peterluger.com/
  Lisandra says Luger's is the best place to eat in Brooklyn.  The steaks are amazing!
  
  Prospect Park https://www.prospectpark.org/
  Prospect Park is beautiful and there's always lots of fun things to do there.  It's also adjacent to Lisandra's favorite Brooklyn Museum.
  
  Brooklyn Museum https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/
  With a rotating selection of interesting and informational exhibits, the Brooklym Museum is always a fun place to visit!  One interesting feature is
  that they have many inventory pieces on "display" in clear glass cases on large shelves.
